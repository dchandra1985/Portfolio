It is very important to understand the data and its types which is very basic to understand the most of the concepts in day to day life. It is a pre-requsite for many applications like statistical measurements, machine learning, project management etc.
Basically data is divided into two types. Numerical and Categorical are the two basic types of data.
Below picture shows the detailed view of different types of data.

## Numerical

Values or observations that can be measured. And these numbers can be placed in ascending or descending order. Scatter plots and line graphs are used to graph numerical data.

Numerical data is further divided into Continuous and Dicrete.

<ul style="list-style-type:none">

<li>  Continuous data represent measurements; their possible values cannot be counted and can only be described using intervals on the real number line.
Height, weight and many which are measured using real numbers are the examples of a continous data.</li>

<li>  Discrete data represent items that can be counted. It can be described as a list of finite values on the whole number.
No. of defects, No. of students in a class are the examples of a discrete data.</li>
