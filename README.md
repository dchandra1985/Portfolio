# Data Science

Data science is a multidisciplinary blend of data inference, algorithmm development, and technology in order to solve analytically complex problems

I have been learning and practicing data science for past few years and thought I would share my experiences along the way as I recap what I have learnt to date. This blog will keep my learning structured and help keep me focused. Hopefully it will also be of some use to anyone new to data science as I share any useful resources I come across.
