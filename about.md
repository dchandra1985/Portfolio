# Welcome!

<img src="_screenshots/dinesh.png">

<div class="right-col">
    <p>Thanks for visiting my personal technology blog</p>

    <p>My name is Dinesh Chandrasekaran, ASQ-CSSBB, PMP, PMI-ACP. I have successfully completed my International Master’s Degree in Turbulence jointly by Ecole Centrale de Lille, Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Mécanique et d’Aérotechnique de Poitiers and Ecole Nationale Supérieure d’Ingénieurs de Poitiers, France. I have around nine years of industry and research experience in project management and data science.</p>

    <p>I have some of my favorite things in life are preparing South Indian food, Chennai city, Chennai Super Kings team etc.</p>

    <p>On a more personal level, I’m constantly trying to learn how to be better at things that really matter, like living intentionally, appreciating people, and adapting to the changes.</p>

    <p>I have been learning and practicing machine learning for past few years and thought I would share my experiences along the way as I recap what I have learnt to date to help solidify what I learn and keep track of my progress. This blog will keep my learning structured and help keep me focused. Hopefully it will also be of some use to anyone new to machine learning as I share any useful resources I come accross.</p>

    <p>For further details on machine learning and statistics contents, please visit the repository on <a href="https://github.com/dchandra1985">Github</a></p>
