    <p>Thank you for visiting my personal technology blog</p>

    <p>I am Dinesh Chandrasekaran, ASQ-CSSBB, PMP, PMI-ACP, SAFe® 4 Agilist (SA), SAFe® 4 Practitioner (SP). I have completed Master of Science offered jointly by Ecole Centrale de Lille, Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Mécanique et d’Aérotechnique de Poitiers and Ecole Nationale Supérieure d’Ingénieurs de Poitiers, France. The Master Program majorly focussed on Turbulence, Mathematical Modeling, Analytical and Computational Techniques.</p>

    <p>I have around nine years of industry and research experience in Data Science and Project Management. Experienced in transforming the project teams to adopt the agile mindset and best practices from Scrum, Lean, Kanban etc. Experienced in developing Machine Learning algorithms and applying Statistical Analysis to improve the product performance.</p>

    <p>My favorite things in life includes South Indian food cuisine, exploring Chennai city and supporting Chennai Super Kings cricket team.</p>

    <p>On a personal note, I am constantly trying to learn how to be better at things that really matters, like living for a purpose, appreciating people, and adapting to the changes.</p>

    <p>I have been learning and practicing data science for past few years and thought I would share my experiences along the way as I recap what I have learnt till date. This blog will keep my learning structured and help me keep focused. Hopefully by sharing useful resources would help someone new to data science.</p>
